# PRODIGY_ML_TASK01
## House Price Prediction

This repository contains code for implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
- Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd PRODIGY_ML_TASK01
```

- Run the house_price_prediction.py script:
```bash
python house_price_prediction.py
```

This script loads the training dataset, selects relevant columns, checks for missing values, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. Finally, it plots the actual vs. predicted house prices.

## Results
The mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) values are calculated to assess the model's performance.
